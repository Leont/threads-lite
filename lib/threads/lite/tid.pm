=head1 NAME

threads::lite::tid - a threads::lite thread id

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.031_001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module represents a thread ID object. It provides a handle to a thread.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 send(@list)

Send a message to a thread. The message items may contain any data type that can be serialized by L<Storable> (including coderefs).

=head2 id()

Get an opaque but primitive identifier for thread.

=head2 monitor()

Monitor the thread. This will cause the calling thread to get a notification of the thread's end. In case of a natural death it returns C<('exit', 'normal', $id, @return_value)>, in case of an unnatural death it will contain C<('exit', 'error', $id, $exception)>.

=head2 rpc(@args)

This is a utility function. It send prepended by the sending process' tid, and waits for a reply prepended by the tid, and returns it without the tid.
