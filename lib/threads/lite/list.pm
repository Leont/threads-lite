=head1 NAME

threads::lite::list - Threaded list utilities

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.023

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module implements threads for perl. One crucial difference with normal threads is that the threads are B<entirely> disconnected, except by message queues (channel). It thus facilitates a message passing style of multi-threading.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 parallel_map { block } $options, @elements

map a list using multiple threads. $options is a hashref whose keys are like in C<new>.

=head2 parallel_grep { block } $options, @elements

grep a list using multiple threads. $options is a hashref whose keys are like in C<new>.

=head1 METHODS

A parallel list processing object can be created if you want to reuse your filter with other arguments.

=head2 new(%options)

Create a new parallel list processing object. It takes three named arguments.

=over 2

=item * code

A reference to the piece of code that should be executed, or it's name. Note that if a name is given, it's containing module must be loaded using C<modules>.

=item * modules

Modules that must be loaded be for the mapping or grepping.

=item * threads

The number of threads you want to use to do the mapping. The default is currently 4, an arbitrary number that may change in the future.

=back

=head2 map(@elements)

Map elements in a parallel manner.

=head2 grep(@elements)

Grep elements in a parallel manner.
